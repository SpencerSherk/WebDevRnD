# WebDev_RnD


This is a collection of personal RnD projects I will continue to add to as I experiment with more Fullstack webdev.

Currently:

ExpressFromScratch_WebFramework

	a reusable web framework that you can use to write simple web applications, implementing many of the features
	present in Express. (includes demo site which loads random images of axolotls) 

	modules used: net, fs   -  no http or express

	showcases:
	- Connection/Route handling
	- demonstrates low level understanding of web frameworks, especially Express



ForestSimulator_DOM-Manipulation

	inspired by this twitter bot:
	https://twitter.com/tiny_forests

	Creates emoji forests by using pure clientside javascript where you can curate some parts of the forest, but also allow randomness to generate other parts. The interface will computes the biodiversity of your forest in realtime.

	showcases:
	- manipulating the DOM
	- setting DOM element attributes
	- handling events with addEventListener




SmashingText_AJAX

	app that saves random strings created by smashing the keyboard with your hands.

	showcases:
	- XMLHttpRequest
    - sending back json from Express
